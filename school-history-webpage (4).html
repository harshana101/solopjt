                According to the existing records of Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya, this school was started in 1926. At the
                beginning, it consisted of eight students and three teachers and the initial principal was <a href="#">Mr. P. C. M.
                Kularatne</a>. The initial student was Mr. Somapala Kularatne, his son. The book states that the school was
                initially located in a house in the Kurunduwatte area and was brought to the current school site in 1929.
                The land where the school is located was a public land where Shanthi Karma Gammadu etc. were held at
                that time and it was later given for the construction of the school. Old records state that in 1929, a
                Sanghagatha Dakshina was started at the current Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya location for a hundred people and
                then the school was started. Initially, three coconut frond sheds were used for teaching.
                <br><br>
                Mr. Kularatne has served as the principal here for a long time. The first permanent building built here is
                the building that currently houses the media unit and the new classroom (Mahasen Hall). The main hall was
                built in 1972 and the other halls were built gradually in various years.
                <br><br>
                Among the principals who served in our school after Mr. Kularatne was a principal named Gunasena. By the
                60s, this school received a teachers' residence and the <strong>Golden Era of Our School</strong> is
                considered to be the service period of Principal Abeywardena. During that period, the school's
                playground was prepared. Also, several buildings including the old laboratory and the home laboratory were
                constructed. It is said that a Venerable Chandaloka served as the deputy principal of this school.
                During that time, many buildings were constructed, fairs were held and films were screened.
                <br><br>
                It is said that former Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike visited this school in 1952. Initially, this
                school was known as the South Mahagama Sucharithawardhana Swabhasha Mixed School. It was a special event
                that a student from Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya was elected to the university for the first time in the 60s. At
                that time, the Advanced Level classes were half-full and the Advanced Level classes started again in the
                late 70s. Six other students entered the university at the same time in the late 70s. After Teacher
                Abhayawardhana left this school for another School, Principal Ranatunga and then Principal Weerakoon served
                as acting principals. During that time, Mr. Amarasena also served as a principal. In 1984, our college
                showed an all-Ceylon level skill in throwing the hoop.
                <br><br>
                Anuradha Samaradiwakara served as the principal of this school from 1986 to 1996. The Buddha Hall of our
                school was built with the patronage of Mr. Calbin and the library building was built with the patronage of
                Mr. Piyasena. It is said that Mr. Ronnie de Mal, who was the Minister of Finance at that time, attended
                the opening of the library building. After Samaradiwakara, Mr. Piyasena Jayananda served as the principal
                for a while and then Principal Piyasoma also served here. After him, Principal Hemadasa passed away while
                serving in this school.
                <br><br>
                Later, Principal Gunasekara served as the acting principal and then Mrs. Siriyawathi served as the acting
                principal. Principal Jayasiri joined this school and served in this school until almost 2012. During that
                time, the school became a secondary school and the primary school was removed. The school also got the
                Mahindodaya Laboratory during that time.
                <br><br>
                From 2012, K. D. Jayapala Principal served as the principal of this school until 2018. During that time, our
                school was also selected for the Best School Nearest School project. Several buildings were renovated with
                the removal of the entrance hall and roofing sheets. The school received two new teachers' houses and the
                old teachers' house was also renovated.
                <br><br>
                Principal Saman Rohana Karunaratne served as the principal of this school from 2018 to 2024. Several
                buildings were renovated during that time. In 2019, ten students from this school enrolled in the
                university.
                <br><br><br>
                The current Principal, Mrs. W.D.D.M. Premathilaka, will assume the position of Principal from 14th February
                2024.
