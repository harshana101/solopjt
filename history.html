        <h2 id="history-title">Our School's History</h2>
        <p id="history-para-1">According to the existing records of Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya, Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya was established in 1926. At the time of its establishment, there were eight students and three teachers, and the founding principal was <a href=””> Mr. P. C. M. Kularatne</a>. He served as the principal for a long time. The founding student was Mr. Somapala Kularatne, P. C. M. Kularatne’s son. <br><br>

It is mentioned in the book that our school was initially located in a house in the Kurunduwatte area and was brought to the current school site in 1929. Old records state that in 1929, a Sanghagatha Dakshina was established at the current Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya site, after which the school was started. Initially, three coconut frond sheds were used for teaching. <br><br>

The first permanent building built here is the building where the media unit and the new Smart classroom are currently located (Mahasen Hall). The main hall was built in 1972 and the other halls were built gradually in various years. <br><br>

Among the principals who served in our school after Mr. Kularatne was a principal named <a href=””>Gunasena</a>. By the 60s, this school received a teachers' residence and the golden era of this school is considered to be the service period of Principal <a href=””>Abeyawardena</a>. During that period, the school's playground was prepared. Also, several buildings including the old laboratory and the home laboratory were constructed. It is said that a Lord named <a href=””>Chandaloka</a> served as the Deputy Principal of this school. During that time, many buildings were constructed by holding fairs and screening films. <br><br>

It is said that former Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike visited this school in 1952. Initially, this school was known as the <strong>South Mahagama Sucharithawardhana Swabhasha Mixed School</strong>. <br><br>

In the 60s, it was a special event that a student from Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya was elected to the university for the first time. At that time, the Advanced Level classes were half-full, and in the late 70s, Advanced Level classes were resumed. Six other students entered the university at the same time in the late 70s. After Teacher Abhayawardhana left this school for another temple, Principal <a href=””>Ranatunga</a> and then Principal <a href=””>Weerakoon</a> served as acting principals. During that time, <a href=””>Mr. Amarasena</a> also served as a principal. In 1984, our school demonstrated an all-Ceylon level skill in throwing the hoop. <br><br>

From 1986 to 96, Principal <a href=””>Anuradha Samaradiwakara</a> served in this school. Our school's Buddha Medura was built with the patronage of Mr. Calvin and the library building was built with the patronage of Mr. M.H. Piyasena. It is said that Mr. Ronnie de Mel, who was the Minister of Finance at that time, attended the opening of the library building. After Principal Samaradiwakara, <a href=””>Mr. Piyasena Jayananda</a> served as the principal for a while and then Principal <a href=””>Piyasoma<a> also served here. After him, Principal <a href=””>Hemadasa</a> passed away while serving in this school. <br><br>

Later, Principal <a href=””>Gunasekara</a> served as the acting principal and then <a href=””>Mrs. Siriyawathi</a> served as the acting principal. Principal <a href=””>Jayasiri</a> came to serve in this school and served in this school until almost 2012. During that <strong>time, this school became a secondary school and the primary school was removed</strong>. The school also received the Mahindodaya Laboratory during this period. <br><br>

From 2012, <a href=””>K. D. Jayapala<a> served as the principal of this school until 2018. During that period, our school was also selected for the Best School Nearest School project. Several buildings were renovated by removing the entrance hall and installing roofing sheets. The school received two new teachers' houses and the old teachers' house was also renovated. <br><br>

Principal <a href=””>Saman Rohana Karunaratne</a> served as the principal of this school from 2018 to 2024. Several buildings were renovated during the same period. In 2019, ten students enrolled in the university from this school. <br><br>

The current Principal, <a href=””>Mrs. W.D.D.M. Premathilaka</a>, will assume the position of Principal from 14th February 2024.
